// The thread's input (thread.go's bottom slot) is a persistent textarea
// on Shell, not one rebuilt per render — so an unsent draft survives
// leaving the tab and coming back (boardSurfacesLive hides, never
// destroys, exactly like the chat pane's m.chat). There is only ever one
// widget, but not one draft: threadDrafts (backlog.go) holds every card's
// line except the one currently loaded into the widget, keyed by
// feature, and openCard/stepCard/closeCard swap the buffer in and out of
// it on every card change — so the persistence is per card, not global.
//
// It is FOCUSED the moment a card page opens, the way a coding agent's
// composer is: the thread is a conversation, and a conversation you have
// to unlock before you can answer it is a worse conversation. Typing
// goes straight in.
//
// It also never gives the keyboard back on esc. That was the original
// trade — esc blurred to the card's single-letter accelerators, esc again
// left the page — and it stopped paying: the accelerator layer it landed
// in has no surface of its own since the action list became an overlay,
// so the first esc appeared to open a mode rather than back out of
// anything, and the status bar swapping wholesale was the only sign it
// had happened. esc leaves the page now, in one press. What the layer
// uniquely offered was J/K; that is alt+j/alt+k here.
//
// The accelerators stay reachable from the line itself, which is where
// the two-way trade actually lives:
//
//   - as words. The closed verb vocabulary (verbs.go) covers what the
//     letters cover — "diff", "approve", "verify" — and the action
//     inventory lists them beside their keys.
//   - as the inventory. Up on an empty line opens it (the placeholder
//     says so), and it carries the keyless actions too — gate, duplicate
//     — which no accelerator ever reached.
//   - as globals. "/" opens the command menu; tab and alt+1/2/3 are
//     answered above every surface.
//
// The blurred accelerator layer still exists (backlog.go's backlogKey),
// but only a card another process drives can be in it: that card
// withholds the composer, so there is nothing for esc to leave from.
//
// While a decision is open the composer and the decision are one control
// (DESIGN §6.3): the composer's emptiness drives the highlight — an empty
// line keeps the highlight where the arrows put it and enter answers it,
// while a typed prose line aims it at the option that consumes words,
// whose label then names what enter will do with them — and enter
// delivers the words to what the screen names. A command never aims: the
// first word being a verb makes the line a command, so the parser (and
// its confirm chip) keeps verb-words while the decision keeps prose; the
// chip's esc hands the line back as a message untouched. With no
// decision, enter is a no-op and up opens the action inventory. None can
// surprise anyone mid-sentence — the moment there is text, they belong to
// the text.

// visible sign of itself is the thing this whole change is undoing.
//
// There used to be a second, quieter placeholder for while a decision was
// pinned above the line, because up belonged to the decision then and
// promising the inventory too would have been a lie one keystroke from
// being found out. F11 made that untrue: up still moves the highlight

// paste. The cap has to be a small number of rows in absolute terms, not
// a fraction of the window. Five is enough to read a multi-sentence
// kickoff note or bounce reason without scrolling — the prose these
// decisions actually carry (deliverDecisionWords) — while still leaving

// it is not — the same question every other surface answers by colour,
// answered the same way (§6.2: focus is answerable without moving).

// No rule above or below it either. In this thread ─── already means a
