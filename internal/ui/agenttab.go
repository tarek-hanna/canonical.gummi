// agentCrashLoopWindow is how soon after starting a child has to exit to
// read as "never really started" rather than "ran, then ended" — the
// line shell.go's agentExitedMsg handler draws before deciding whether to
// respawn it.
//
// Three seconds is comfortably longer than a CLI takes to fail on a bad
// flag, missing auth, or an absent config file — those exits are
// essentially instant — and comfortably shorter than any interactive
// session a person would call "it ran". There's no back-off or attempt
// counter behind it: one fast exit is enough to stop, on the theory that
// whatever made it fail (a missing API key, an unwritable state dir)
// isn't going to fix itself between one attempt and the next, and a
// silent retry loop is a worse failure than a CLI that stops and says why.

// agenttab.go is the Shell's half of the agent tab: it decides when to

// owns the pty and the terminal emulation and knows nothing about tabs;
// everything here is the wiring that agentview.go's doc comment defers to
// its caller.
//
// The split matters for one structural reason: every other surface in this
// package renders by returning a string that mainView hands to
// uv.NewStyledString. The agent tab cannot. Its content is a cell grid the
// emulator composites straight into the screen buffer, so it is drawn in
// Shell.draw (see drawAgentTab) rather than through mainView, which
// returns only the not-configured placeholder for this tab.

// agentSpawnErr is the notice shown in place of the hosted CLI when it
// could not start. It is a field rather than a transient notice because
// the tab must keep explaining itself every frame the user looks at it,
// not for the few seconds a status-bar pill survives.

// resolveAgentAttach picks the CLI to host, the directory to host it in,

//
// Precedence, checked in this order (this is the only place it is
// applied — rawattach.go's `a` raw-attach hatch and the engine's own
// per-role backend selection in cmd/gummi are separate features with
// their own precedence, deliberately untouched by this one):
//
//  1. GUMMI_ATTACH_CMD — an explicit full command line, the operator
//     escape hatch that always wins, exactly as it does for `a`. There is
//     no vendor name to recognize here, so backend falls back to the
//     resolved binary itself below — enough identity to detect "the same
//     raw command ran last time", never enough to guess a resume flag
//     from (agentResumeArgs treats every unrecognized backend the same).
//  2. GUMMI_AGENT — an explicit backend name, resolved through
//     defaultAttachCommand's own name→binary mapping (rawattach.go) so
//     an operator using this one env var for both the engine and the
//     agent tab gets one consistent answer instead of two that could
//     drift apart. The env value itself (lowercased) is the backend
//     identity — including values with no resume form (opencode, zz,
//     headless), which is fine: they simply never match a case in
//     agentResumeArgs.
//  3. config `agent:` — the workspace config.yaml selection
//     agentpicker.go's picker persists via config.SetAgent
//     (m.agentConfigName, loaded once at startup by SetAgentConfig).
//     Chosen once, it survives restarts with no env var and no re-ask.
//     agentConfigName is already one of agentcli.Known()'s stable names,
//     so it doubles as the backend identity directly.
//  4. nothing configured — reported as a problem rather than guessed at.
//     This is the fix for the bug this feature exists to close: the old
//     code fell through to a hardcoded "copilot" here, so a user without
//     copilot installed got a silent missing-binary error instead of a
//     choice. Init's first-run trigger (agentConfigured) is what keeps
//     step 4 from actually being reached on a normal first start — this
//     problem string is what a user sees only if they dismiss the
//     picker with esc and then visit the tab anyway.
//
// The directory is the workspace root, not a card's worktree: this agent
// manages the board rather than living inside one card, and pointing it
// at a worktree would silently scope it to whichever card happened to be
// selected when the tab was first opened.
