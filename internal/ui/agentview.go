// agentView hosts a real terminal program — the user's own coding CLI,
// resolved the same way rawattach.go resolves it (defaultAttachCommand /
// GUMMI_ATTACH_CMD) — inside a pty, and renders its screen as an
// ultraviolet-drawable surface so it can sit in a tab of gummi's own TUI
// instead of taking over the real terminal the way attachRaw does.
//
// It is deliberately Shell-agnostic: it owns the pty, the child process,
// and a headless terminal emulator, and exposes only Draw/Resize/input/
// lifecycle methods. Wiring it into a tab (spawning it on tab-enter,
// forwarding key messages, repainting on Wait()'s messages, tearing it
// down on tab-leave or shell exit) is the caller's job.
//
// The terminal emulation is github.com/charmbracelet/x/vt's Emulator,
// wrapped in its SafeEmulator for the concurrency this type needs: one
// goroutine feeds it bytes read from the pty while Draw (called from the
// main render loop) reads its cell grid at the same time. x/vt composites
// directly into this repo's ultraviolet.Screen — see
// TestEmulatorDrawsIntoRepoUltravioletScreenBuffer, which pins that
// assumption so a future bump of either module can't silently break it
// (x/vt names an older ultraviolet in its own go.mod; Go's MVS resolves
// the build to this repo's newer pin, and the two have stayed
// wire-compatible so far — but "so far" is exactly the kind of thing a
// dependency bump invalidates without a test to catch it).
