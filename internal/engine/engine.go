// Package engine is gummi's orchestrator: it binds features' stages to
// agent sessions, schedules autonomous runs (DESIGN §4.2), routes turns,
// and streams typed activity to the UI.
//
// Interactive sessions (brainstorm/spec chat) run whenever you attach
// and hold no slot — you are the scarce resource. Autonomous sessions
// (plan/implement/review/verify) start as soon as they are run: how many
// cards to drive at once is the operator's call, not the engine's, so
// max_active is unlimited by default. Setting it to a positive number
// re-imposes a cap for anyone who wants one — excess runs then queue and
// start automatically as slots free (a session freeing its slot on
// pause, or on going idle when its turn completes).
