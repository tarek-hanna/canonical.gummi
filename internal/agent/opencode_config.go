// buildOpencodeConfig renders the per-session OPENCODE_CONFIG file content
// for an opencode-driven session. It emits exactly two blocks: opencode's
// `permission` (always) and `mcp.gummi` (only when an MCP socket is present
// alongside a feature id or workspace is set — the same "socket plus
// something to bind it to" gate every other adapter uses). Anything else
// opencode reads — models, keybinds, bash tool policies — stays under
// operator control in the global opencode.jsonc, which this file merges on
// top of.
//
// workspace mirrors SessionOpts.Workspace: it swaps the emitted
// mcp.gummi.command's trailing args from ["__mcp","--feature",featureID]
// to ["__mcp","--workspace"], so the spawned child binds the board-level
// endpoint instead of naming a card. featureID is otherwise unused when
// workspace is true — same convention as the claudecode/codex builders in
// gummi_mcp.go, kept here even though this file's config shape (a JSON
// blob wrapping opencode's own schema, not gummi's) is otherwise unrelated
// to theirs.
//
// The permission block cages opencode's file tools to the worktree: edit
// (which gates both opencode's edit and write tools) is pinned to a
// pattern→action map allowing only `<worktree>/**` and denying everything
// else, and external_directory is denied. When the caller names specific
// extra reads (ExtraReadAllows), external_directory must be opened
// (opencode's deny gates the fs tools generally, so a per-file read
// allowance cannot slip through otherwise) and the named paths are then
// whitelisted under `read`, while edits/writes stay caged by permission.edit.
//
// Note that opencode's shell (`bash`) tool is deliberately NOT caged here:
// its policy is command-string based rather than path based, so a real cage
// requires process-level confinement, which is out of scope for this feature
// (see FD-014 sandbox mode). opencode strips // comments from its JSON config,
// so this note lives in the Go source only.
