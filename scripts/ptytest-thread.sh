# regression suite for the CARD THREAD view — the surface the card
# page opens onto (internal/ui/thread.go, threadinput.go, decision.go).
# Everything here runs against a real gummi binary inside tmux and
# asserts on what the pane actually shows; nothing is stubbed at the
# render layer, because the whole class of defect this hunts (a key the
# composer swallows, a hint the bar sheds, a row a short terminal drops)
# only exists once a real terminal is holding the frame.
#
#   scripts/ptytest-thread.sh
#
# It is deliberately separate from ptytest-tui.sh, which owns the board,
# the command menu and the creation forms. This one owns the thread.
#
# It began as a defect ledger — twenty-one findings from a pty drive of
# the new card page, each one asserted as an xfail so that fixing it
# would say so out loud. All of them are fixed, and every xfail has been
# promoted to a real assertion. The `known` helpers below are kept
# rather than deleted: the next drive that finds something will want
# them, and a defect recorded as a passing-by-omission comment is a
# defect nobody re-checks.
#
# Three verdicts, not two:
#   ok        the behaviour is right and asserted
#   FAIL      a regression — the run exits non-zero
#   KNOWN     a defect recorded on purpose (xfail). It does not fail the
#             run; when it stops reproducing the line flips to "FIXED,
#             promote this assertion", which is the signal to turn it
#             into an expect.
